## Array

### What Is an Array?
> An Array is a collection of items. The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, games, booksâ€”anything really. The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. Because they're stored together, checking through the entire collection of items is straightforward.

### Array Capacity VS Length
- If somebody asks you how long the DVD Array is, what what would your answer be?
There are two different answers you might have given.
    - The number of DVDs the box could hold, if it was full, or
    - The number of DVDs currently in the box.
